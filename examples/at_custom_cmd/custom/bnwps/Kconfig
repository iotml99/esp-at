            When enabled, AT+BNWPS will disconnect from current AP before starting WPS.
            When disabled, AT+BNWPS will return error if already connected to an AP.
            
            Enable this option if you want to allow switching networks via WPS.
            Disable this option for more conservative behavior that protects existing connections.
